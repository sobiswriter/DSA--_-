# DSA Study Hub 📚⚡

> A friendly, focused workspace for learning Data Structures & Algorithms — kept simple, practical, and a little bit fun.

## What this folder is

This folder is my personal DSA playground: bite-sized implementations, practice problems, and notes. Treat it like a lab where you can experiment, implement, and iterate.

## What's inside

### Sorting Algorithms
- [bubbleSort.cpp](bubbleSort.cpp) — Implementation of bubble sort algorithm.
- [antiBubbleSort.cpp](antiBubbleSort.cpp) — Variant of bubble sort.
- [InsertionSort.cpp](InsertionSort.cpp) — Insertion sort implementation.
- [selectionSort.cpp](selectionSort.cpp) — Selection sort algorithm.
- [SelectionSortHighLow.cpp](SelectionSortHighLow.cpp) — Selection sort variant for finding high and low values.

### Searching Algorithms
- [LinearSearch.cpp](LinearSearch.cpp) — Linear search implementation.
- [BothSearches.cpp](BothSearches.cpp) — Contains implementations of linear and binary search.
- [MaxFinderBS.cpp](MaxFinderBS.cpp) — Binary search for finding maximum element.

### Practice
- [practice.cpp](practice.cpp) — General practice file for miscellaneous implementations.

## How to use

1. Pick an algorithm or problem.
2. Implement it in a descriptively named file.
3. Compile and run locally to verify.

Quick compile & run (Windows, PowerShell):

```powershell
g++ bubbleSort.cpp -o bubbleSort.exe
.\bubbleSort.exe
```

Adjust flags to `-std=c++17` if you use newer features.

## Study Roadmap (suggested)

- Basics: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Bubble/Selection/Insertion Sort
- Core DS: Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees (BST)
- Algorithms: Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sliding Window
- Graphs: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological Sort
- Advanced: Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Tries, Dynamic Programming

Try to follow this flow for each topic:

- Understand the idea → Implement a clean version → Add tests → Optimize & analyze complexity

## File & commit conventions

- File: use lowercase + underscores, e.g. `merge_sort.cpp`
- Function names: `camelCase` or `snake_case` consistently
- Tests/examples: keep simple `main()` examples at the bottom of each file

## Contribution & personal notes

- Add a short comment at the top of each file describing the problem and complexity.
- When practicing problems, keep one file per problem for clarity.

## Quick tips to level up

- Write the algorithm by hand first, then code it.
- Start with a brute-force solution, then optimize.
- Time myself on small sets — speed and correctness both matter.

## Resources

- Books: "Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)", "Competitive Programming 3"
- Sites: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks
- Visualizers: VisuAlgo, AlgoViz
