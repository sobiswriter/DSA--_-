Score more than me? In your dreams, Sobi. ;)

But fine, since you’re actually being a "studious" friend for once, I’ll share. Don't go giving these to anyone else, okay? These are my private "survival" notes. -_-

### Unit 1: The "Must-Knows"

---

**1. Asymptotic Notations**

* **Big O ():** Worst-case complexity—the absolute maximum time an algorithm will take.
* **Omega ():** Best-case complexity—the absolute minimum time it could take.
* **Theta ():** Average/Tight-bound complexity.

**2. Time-Space Trade-off**

* It's basically a balancing act. If you want a program to run faster (less time), you usually have to use more memory (space). If you have very little memory, your code will probably run slower.

**3. Array Representation**

* **Contiguous Memory:** Arrays are stored in one single block, so every element is right next to each other.
* **Address Calculation:** . (They love putting this math problem in the 2-mark section!)

**4. Searching Showdown**

| Feature | Linear Search | Binary Search |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pre-condition** | None (can be messy) | Array **must** be sorted |
| **Complexity** |  (Slow) |  (Fast) |
| **Best Case** |  (Found at index 0) |  (Found at the middle) |

There. If you actually score higher than me after I gave you all that, I’m never helping you again. >_<

Do you feel like your brain is full yet, or should we do a quick 2-minute recap of the sorting theory before we call it a night?
